# Tedenski pregled (weekly digest)

Output: one new file `src/content/novice/YYYY-MM-DD-tedenski-pregled-N.md` on a branch
`pregled/YYYY-MM-DD`, optionally up to 3 new entries in `src/data/slovar.yaml`, and an open
pull request. **Never merge, never push to `main`.** Merging
is publishing, and only Anže does that.

Repo: `/Users/anze/Desktop/Claude/ej-aj` (public, `ej-aj-pro/ej-aj`). Read `AGENTS.md` and
`docs/slog.md` there first: their writing, accuracy and confidentiality rules apply to
everything below.

GitHub auth: the active `gh` account is a different one and must not be switched. Prefix every
network command (`git fetch`, `git push`, `gh ...`) with
`GH_TOKEN="$(gh auth token --user ej-aj-pro 2>/dev/null || gh auth token --user AnzeNocAI)"`.

## 1. Set up a clean worktree

Do not touch the main checkout (Anže may have uncommitted work there).

```bash
cd /Users/anze/Desktop/Claude/ej-aj
GH_TOKEN="$(gh auth token --user ej-aj-pro 2>/dev/null || gh auth token --user AnzeNocAI)" git fetch origin
TODAY=$(date +%F)
WT=/Users/anze/.cache/ej-aj-worktrees/pregled-$TODAY
mkdir -p /Users/anze/.cache/ej-aj-worktrees
git worktree add "$WT" -b "pregled/$TODAY" origin/main
cd "$WT" && npm ci --silent
```

If the branch already exists on origin (an earlier run today), stop and report it instead of
creating a second PR. Work only inside `$WT` from here on.

## 2. Work out the issue number and window

- Previous issue: the `tedenski-pregled` file in `src/content/novice/` with the newest `date`.
- `N` = previous number + 1.
- Window: from the day after the previous issue's `date` up to and including today.
- `period` in front matter, Slovenian: `27. september do 2. oktober 2026` (month names in
  lowercase, no dashes).

## 3. Collect candidates with three parallel subagents

Launch these three with the Agent tool **in one message** so they run in parallel
(`subagent_type: general-purpose`, `model: sonnet`). Give each the window dates and the prompt
below with its own source list. Tell them to use WebFetch for HTML pages and `curl` for RSS, and
to return only JSON.

Shared prompt text for every collector:

> Find AI news published between {START} and {END} (inclusive) from the sources below. For each
> real, dated announcement return an object: `title` (English, as published), `date`
> (YYYY-MM-DD), `url` (the primary source, the company's own page if one exists), `extra_urls`
> (reputable secondary coverage, optional), `facts` (3 to 6 short factual bullet points copied
> in substance from the page: numbers, prices, availability, names), `category` (model, product,
> research, policy, slovenia, business). Skip anything outside the window, anything you could
> not open, rumours without a named outlet, funding rounds under 1 billion USD, and stock or
> chip news. Never invent a URL or a number: if a page did not load, leave the item out and add
> it to `failed_sources`. Return JSON only: `{"items": [...], "failed_sources": [...]}`.

Source-specific tips (learned from test runs; pass the relevant ones to each collector):

- anthropic.com/news: WebFetch's summary gets dates wrong. Fetch the raw HTML with `curl` and
  read the `<time>` tags.
- claude.com/blog: paginated; older posts are at `?b7eea976_page=2`. Skip guides and
  thought-leadership posts, keep dated product and customer announcements.
- Claude Code: the changelog has no dates. Map versions to dates with the GitHub Releases API
  (`gh api repos/anthropics/claude-code/releases --paginate --jq '.[] | [.tag_name, .published_at] | @tsv'`)
  and link the release page. Keep only notable user-facing features.
- openai.com returns 403 to scripts. Use help.openai.com release notes, the OpenAI developer
  community, developers.openai.com, or reputable coverage, and say which one you used.

Source lists:

- **A (Anthropic and Claude):** https://www.anthropic.com/news, the Claude Code changelog
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anthropics/claude-code/main/CHANGELOG.md (only notable
  user-facing features, not bug fixes), https://claude.com/blog if it exists.
- **B (other labs):** https://openai.com/news/ (often blocks scripts; then use
  https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6825453-chatgpt-release-notes and reputable coverage such
  as techcrunch.com, theverge.com), https://blog.google/technology/ai/,
  https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/changelog, https://mistral.ai/news,
  https://ai.meta.com/blog/, https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ai/blog/.
- **C (Slovenia and EU):** https://www.gov.si/novice/ (search "umetna inteligenca"),
  https://kcui.si/novice/, https://www.fri.uni-lj.si/sl/novice, https://www.rtvslo.si/znanost-in-tehnologija,
  https://n1info.si/magazin/digitalno/, https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/news (AI Act,
  AI Office). Slovenian news counts only if it is about AI and has a concrete fact (a decision,
  a programme, a model, an event with results).

Also read, as a list of leads only, Anže's private weekly reports: every
`/Users/anze/Desktop/Claude/GitHub Repository (Anze)/knowledge/ai-research/tedenski-pregled/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
dated inside the window (a separate routine writes one on Friday morning, before this one runs).
They summarise about 20 newsletters and podcasts (Ben's Bites, The Neuron, How I AI, Nate B Jones,
Simon Willison and others) and are the main source of leads for practical items: new tools and
features, real company use cases, methods for bringing AI into work, skills, company memory.
These newsletters are secondary sources: for every lead you use, find and open the primary source
(the company's own announcement, documentation or case study) and link that. If there is no
primary source, link the newsletter and say whose account it is. Never copy text, ideas for
workshops or client references from those reports; they are private. If no report exists for
the window, carry on without it and say so under **Za preveriti**.

## 4. Select 5 to 10 items

Reader: a Slovenian business person curious about AI, not an engineer. Pick what changes what
they can do or buy. A good mix: 2 to 3 model or product releases, 1 practical feature,
1 research or safety story if it is striking, 1 policy or EU item, 1 Slovenian item when there
is a real one, 1 concrete use case or adoption method (how a company actually uses AI) when
there is one with a primary source. Merge duplicates (one item, several sources). Drop items whose facts you cannot
support with an opened page. Fewer good items beat more weak ones; 5 is fine.

## 5. Write the draft

Follow the format in `AGENTS.md` ("Weekly digest format") and the first issue
`src/content/novice/2026-09-26-tedenski-pregled-1.md` as the model for tone and length:

- Front matter: `title: 'Tedenski pregled #N: <3 to 4 main topics>'`, `description` (max 200
  characters, one sentence), `date: <today>`, `type: tedenski-pregled`, `period`.
- One-sentence intro, then `> **Na kratko:** ...` with the one takeaway of the week.
- Items as `## 1. <Slovenian headline>`: 3 to 5 factual sentences (who, what, when, numbers,
  availability), then `**Kaj to pomeni za vas:** <one or two sentences, concrete for a Slovenian
  company>`, then `Vir: [Name, title](url)` or `Viri: [..](..), [..](..)`.
- Reports and plans are labelled ("po poročanju ...", "gre za načrt").
- Last line: `Naslednji pregled izide v petek, <d. month>.`
- Slovenian formats: `1.500`, `0,10 USD`, `40 %`, dates `22. septembra`. No em or en dashes.

## 5b. Propose glossary entries for new terms

The site has a glossary (`src/data/slovar.yaml`, pages `/slovar/<id>/`), and the first mention
of every glossary term in an article is linked to it automatically
(`src/markdown/slovar-povezave.mjs`). New terms from this week's news should end up there.

1. List the technical terms the draft uses that a Slovenian business reader might not know
   (for example "agentni brskalnik", "destilacija", "MoE"). Ignore product and company names,
   and terms already in `slovar.yaml` under any form (check `izraz`, `angl` and the plugin's
   `PHRASES`).
2. Pick at most 3 that are likely to come up again. If none qualifies, skip this step and write
   "Nova gesla: brez" in the PR body.
3. Add each to `src/data/slovar.yaml`, following the rules in the file header: `id` (slug
   without č/š/ž), `izraz` (Slovenian term, English or acronym in parentheses if common),
   `angl`, `razlaga` (2 to 4 sentences, general, no prices, model names or dates that go stale),
   optional `primer`, and `glej` with 1 to 3 related existing ids. Place it next to related
   entries. Plain language per `docs/slog.md`, no em or en dashes.
4. If the headword is also an everyday Slovenian word or a brand, add an entry to `PHRASES` or
   `SKIP` in `src/markdown/slovar-povezave.mjs` so the automatic links stay precise.
5. Check the result: after `npm run build`, the digest page must link the new term
   (`grep -o 'href="/slovar/<id>/"' dist/novice/<slug>/index.html`).

## 6. Verify every claim (separate subagent)

Launch one subagent (`subagent_type: general-purpose`, default model) with the full draft and
this task:

> You are a fact-checker. For every numbered item, open each linked source with WebFetch (or a
> secondary link if the primary blocks scripts) and check every number, date, name, price and
> availability claim in the factual sentences. The "Kaj to pomeni za vas" sentence is opinion;
> only flag it if it states a fact that is wrong. Return JSON:
> `{"items": [{"n": 1, "status": "ok" | "fix" | "drop", "problems": ["claim -> what the source says"]}]}`.
> Be strict: a claim the source does not state is a problem, even if it is probably true.
> Also check any new glossary entries in `src/data/slovar.yaml` (listed below): is the
> definition correct and general enough not to go stale? Return them as
> `{"glossary": [{"id", "status": "ok" | "fix" | "drop", "problems": [...]}]}`.

Apply every fix. Drop items marked `drop`, renumber, and keep at least 5 (if you end with fewer
than 5, continue anyway and open the PR as a draft, explaining why in the PR body).

## 7. Deterministic checks

```bash
node scripts/og-slike.mjs          # share image public/og/<id>.png (needs this Mac's fonts)
node scripts/preveri.mjs --links src/content/novice/<file>.md
npm run build
```

Both must pass. Fix every NAPAKA. OPOZORILO about 403 from openai.com is expected; mention it
in the PR body. Other warnings: fix if they are real.

## 8. Commit, push, open the PR

```bash
git add src/content/novice/<file>.md src/data/slovar.yaml src/markdown/slovar-povezave.mjs public/og scripts/og-slike.json
git commit -m "Weekly digest #N (<period>)" -m "Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>"
GH_TOKEN="$(gh auth token --user ej-aj-pro 2>/dev/null || gh auth token --user AnzeNocAI)" git push -u origin "pregled/$TODAY"
GH_TOKEN="$(gh auth token --user ej-aj-pro 2>/dev/null || gh auth token --user AnzeNocAI)" gh pr create --repo ej-aj-pro/ej-aj \
  --base main --head "pregled/$TODAY" --title "Tedenski pregled #N (<period>)" --body-file <body.md>
```

PR body (Slovenian, short):

- one line: what the issue covers and how many items
- a checklist, one line per item: `- [ ] <headline> (vir: <domain>)`
- **Nova gesla v slovarju:** one line per entry, `- [ ] <izraz>: <first sentence of razlaga>`
  with a link to `/slovar/<id>/` on the preview, or "brez". Anže deletes the ones he doesn't
  want before merging.
- **Za preveriti:** anything the fact-checker could not confirm, sources that failed, and
  anything you were unsure about
- validator result (errors / warnings) and "Build: OK"
- last line: "Merge = objava na ej-aj.si. Cloudflare bo spodaj dodal preview povezavo."

Then remove the worktree: `cd /Users/anze/Desktop/Claude/ej-aj && git worktree remove "$WT"`.

## 9. Final message

Slovenian, short: the PR link, the item headlines, new glossary entries, failed sources,
anything Anže must check.
If a step failed, say which one and what state things were left in. Do not work around a
failure silently.
